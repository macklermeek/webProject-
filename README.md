# Web Systems project 
### This website is for a frat at the University of Wisconsin- Eau claire
### In this project we used html, css and react together. 


# Features
- Database for interested members
- clean pages that are easy to read and understand.
- Contact pages for both members and alumni


  # Teach
  This website uses a bit of software to be able to function.
  - <ins>Html</ins> - all of our frontend code is done with html
  - <ins>Css</ins> - this ties into html is allows for styling on the website
  - <ins>React</ins> - This is the backend to our website and what deploys it show everyone can see
  - <ins>Visual Studio Code</ins> - This is what we used to code evrything. You dont need to have the exact one but you will need a code editor this is just one I suggest
  - <ins>Github</ins> - Since this was a group project it was crutial to have an easy way to share our code with each other. I highly suggest learning github as you will use it eventaully.
 
  ## Installation
  There are not many things you need to install. For html and css you just need a text editor in order to use them.

  You can install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) here (from now on I will refer to it as VS code)
  
  For react to fucntion you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
