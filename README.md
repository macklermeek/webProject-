# Web Systems project 
### This website is for a frat at the University of Wisconsin- Eau claire
### In this project we used html, css and react together. 


# Features
- Database for interested members
- clean pages that are easy to read and understand.
- Contact pages for both members and alumni


  # Teach
  This website uses a bit of software to be able to function.
  - <ins>Html</ins> - all of our frontend code is done with html
  - <ins>Css</ins> - this ties into html is allows for styling on the website
  - <ins>React</ins> - This is the backend to our website and what deploys it show everyone can see
  - <ins>Visual Studio Code</ins> - This is what we used to code evrything. You dont need to have the exact one but you will need a code editor this is just one I suggest
  - <ins>Github</ins> - Since this was a group project it was crutial to have an easy way to share our code with each other. I highly suggest learning github as you will use it eventaully.
 
  ## Installation
  There are not many things you need to install. For html and css you just need a text editor in order to use them.

  You can install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) here (from now on I will refer to it as VS code)
  
  For react to fucntion you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

  ## Starting the project

There are two way you can start this project the first is getting all your html and css files done. Then transfering them over to react.

Or 

Start react first and code along the way see your website come togehter in real time

I would agrue to do the second one as it requires less work and when you are finished you will have a website. However it might be more diffcult and confusing if you have no prior knowledge of html and css. We did it the first way due to the 
outlines of our project that our professor gave us. 

Now whichever way you choose to go this to start an react project you will type
